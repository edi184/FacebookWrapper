# Messenger Lite by edi194

It is simple Android app with Webview to load Facebook Messenger website.

Working ATM:
- logging in and messaging,
- everything what is online (stickers, emoji).

TODO:
- notifications,
- scale for other display sizes (now work on xxhdpi, 1080p).

Not working:
- image sharing, taking photos inside app,
- microphone recording.

Do what you want with it with proper credits.
